    "* Stack, Queues, Deques are **Linear Data structures** like array\n",
    "* They're very similar to arrays, but differ on how it add and remove items\n",
    "* *A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at same end.*\n",
    "* This end is commonly referred as **top**.\n",
    "* The end opposite to top is known as **base**.  \n",
    "* Example : You can think of a stack as stack of books on a table, so the base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represents those that have been in stack the longest.\n",
    "* The most recently addad item is the one that is in position to be removed first.\n",
    "* This ordering is sometimes called LIFO, last-in first-out.\n",
    "* It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection.\n",
    "* Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.\n",
    "![](stack.JPG)  \n",
    "* Note how the first items \"Pushed\" to the stack begin at the base, and as items are \"popped\" out.\n",
    "* Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items.\n",
    "* The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal\n",
    "* Considering this reversal property, you can perhaps think of exammples of stacks that occur as you use your computer.\n",
    "* For example: Every web browser has a back button.\n",
    "* As you navigate from web page to webpage, those pages are placed on a stack(URL's)\n",
    "* The current page that you are viewing is on the top and hte first page you looked at is at the base.\n",
